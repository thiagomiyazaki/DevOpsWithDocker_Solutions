# Solution to exercises from DevOpswithDocker

Hello!<br>
Some description on how I presented the solutions:

- Commands and outputs have been placed into text files (.txt)
- Dockerfiles are prefixed by the corresponding associated exercise (EX1_13_Dockerfile = Dockerfile from exercise 1.13). The same logic applies for docker-container.yaml files (EX2_01_docker-compose.yaml = docker-compose file from exercise 2.01).
- For the *exercise 1.15* please run `docker run -p 80:80 thiagomiyazaki/metro-app-miya` to run the container solution. In the folder you will find the Dockerfile associated to this container.<br><br>

Unfortunately I didn't have enough time to finish part3. But I learned a lot from parts 1 and 2! <br>
Thanks a lot for taking the time to review the exercises and for the course!
