# Exercise 1.15 (DevOps with Docker)

Hello! Please, to run this container execute:

```
docker run -p 80:80 thiagomiyazaki/metro-app-miya
```

Then, go to http://localhost 

There should be my metronome app! The container consists of react app built with vite and nginx.

Also, I am adding the dockerfile here, in case of any doubts! <br>
Thanks a lot for reviewing my exercises!
